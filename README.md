## Goal

### The Problem

> [Since WP-CLI v2.0.0,] the most problematic set of the dependencies, the hard requirement on an old version of Symfony, is gone. The only Symfony component we still have (yet) is `symfony/finder`, as thereâ€™s no upper version limit for that one.
>
> -- https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2018/08/08/wp-cli-v2-0-0-release-notes/

However, the phar bundles with [WP-CLI's dependencies](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/blob/bc37f66e25b9992813b0c50b933aefbf88718e6a/composer.lock). Those dependencies' always being loaded from the phar. As a result, their versions are _locked_.

For example: WP-CLI v2.4.0 phar bundles with [`symfony/process` v2.8.5](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle/blob/v2.4.0/composer.lock#L1205-L1206) (as a dependency of `symfony/finder`). Assume we have `my-awesome-command` which requires `symfony/process:5.0.0`. `$ wp package install my-awesome-command` installs `symfony/process` v5.0.0 as expected. However, `symfony/process` v2.8.5 (from the WP-CLI phar) is always used; the newer version of `symfony/process` (which required by `my-awesome-command`) is being ignored. Thus, `my-awesome-command` fails when trying to use `symfony/process`.

```sh-session
$ wp shell

wp> $reflector = new \ReflectionClass('Symfony\Component\Process\Process');
=> object(ReflectionClass)#2801 (1) {
  ["name"]=>
  string(33) "Symfony\Component\Process\Process"
}
wp> echo $reflector->getFileName(); // Note that it is loaded form the WP-CLI phar.
phar:///usr/bin/wp/vendor/symfony/process/Process.php
```

This problem affects `symfony/finder` and its dependencies.

### The Solution

[Installing WP-CLI via composer](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-composer) resolves the problem.

```sh-session
$ wp shell

wp> $reflector = new \ReflectionClass('Symfony\Component\Process\Process');
=> object(ReflectionClass)#2801 (1) {
  ["name"]=>
  string(33) "Symfony\Component\Process\Process"
}
wp> echo $reflector->getFileName(); // Note that it is loaded form composer's vendor folder.
/home/web/.composer/vendor/symfony/process/Process.php
```

- Python v3.7.6 or later

## Installation

1. Add `itinerisltd.trellis_install_wp_cli_via_composer` to `galaxy.yml`
    ```diff
      # galaxy.yml

    + - src: itinerisltd.trellis_install_wp_cli_via_composer
    + version: 0.1.1 # Check for latest version!
    ```

2. Replace `wp-cli` role with `itinerisltd.trellis_install_wp_cli_via_composer`
    ```diff
      # server.yml

    - - { role: wp-cli, tags: [wp-cli] }
    + - { role: itinerisltd.trellis_install_wp_cli_via_composer, tags: [wp-cli] }
    ```

3. Install galaxy roles
    ```bash
    trellis galaxy install
    # Alternatively
    ansible-galaxy install -r galaxy.yml --force
    ```

4. Re-provision
    ```bash
    trellis provision production
    # Alternatively
    ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=production
    ```

## FAQ

### How to install certain commands only instead of the whole WP-CLI bundle?

By default, the whole WP-CLI bundle ([`wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle`](https://packagist.org/packages/wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle)) installed. If you want to keep your servers _lean_, install command packages selectively:

```yaml
wp_cli_composer_global_remove_packages:
  - wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle

wp_cli_composer_global_require_packages:
  # Required: WP-CLI framework
  - "wp-cli/wp-cli:^2.4"
  # Only install commands you need:
  - "wp-cli/core-command:^2"
  - "wp-cli/cron-command:^2"
  - "wp-cli/db-command:^2"
  - "wp-cli/package-command:^2"
```

### What to do when composer couldn't install packages because of  conflicting version constraints?

Double check existing composer packages. Then, change [version constraints](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md) via [role variables](#role-variables). You might need to uninstall some packages.

These commands are your friends:

```bash
composer global show
cat $(composer config --global --absolute home)/composer.json

wp package list
cat $(wp package path)/composer.json
```

### How to verify WP-CLI is installed via composer?

```sh-session
# Bad: Installed via Trellis, i.e: the phar
$ wp cli info
WP-CLI root dir:	phar://wp-cli.phar/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli
```

```sh-session
# Good: Installed via this role, i.e: composer
$ wp cli info
WP-CLI root dir:	/home/web/.composer/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli
```

### Is it idempotent or deterministic?

No.

Specific exact package versions might help but you will need to manage them manually.
